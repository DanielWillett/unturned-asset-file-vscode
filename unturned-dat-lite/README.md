# Unturned Data File (Lite)

This is the 'lite' version of the Unturned Data File extension 
which adds proper syntax highlighting to Unturned's .dat/.asset files.
It does not include the language server features.

If you want a more in-depth editing experience try the [full version](https://github.com/DanielWillett/unturned-asset-file-vscode/tree/master/unturned-dat) instead (also free).

See the [GitHub](https://github.com/DanielWillett/unturned-asset-file-vscode) to contribute or report a bug.
