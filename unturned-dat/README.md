# Unturned Data File

**This extension is not completed and will be released at a later date when it's useable**

This is the full version of the Unturned Data File extension 
which adds proper syntax highlighting to Unturned's .dat/.asset files.
It also adds auto-complete, diagnostics, and more features expected in a full IDE experience.

If you want a more lightweight editing experience try the [lite version](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DanielWillett.unturned-data-file-lite) instead.

See the [GitHub](https://github.com/DanielWillett/unturned-asset-file-vscode) to contribute or report a bug.
